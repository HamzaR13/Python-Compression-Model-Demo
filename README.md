![2023-02-20 (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53bae5eb-5fa1-4e67-a71f-a9312feae8d3)

This project demonstrates a basic Python compression model using Huffman Trees.

**Project Description:**  
- Supports binary data compression.  
- Good OOP and API design.  
- Safe for employers to see (no direct code copying).  
- Academic Warning:  
  - This is **not** the same code as my academic submission.  
  - It’s a demonstration of my skills as described in my resume.  
  - **Do not copy or use this code for academic purposes.**  
- Showcases:  
  1️⃣ `compression_utils.py` – helper functions  
  2️⃣ `huffman_tree.py` – tree classes  
  3️⃣ `compressor.py` – compression logic  
  4️⃣ `test_compressor.py` – some pytest tests  

**Project Features:**  
- Frequency dictionary creation  
- Huffman Tree building  
- Code mapping and data compression  
- Tests with `pytest`
