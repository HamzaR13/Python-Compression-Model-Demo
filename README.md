# Python Compression Demo

This project demonstrates a basic Python compression model using Huffman Trees.
- Supports binary data compression.
- Good OOP and API design.
- Safe for employers to see (no direct code copying).

**Warning:**  
- This is **not** the same code as my academic submission.  
- Itâ€™s a demonstration of my skills as described in my resume.

## Project Features
- Frequency dictionary creation
- Huffman Tree building
- Code mapping and data compression
- Tests with `pytest`
